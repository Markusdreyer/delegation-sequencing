* Operations
** Add/Remove
   Two versions: with or without time points. Without timepoints means any timepoints.


* Observations

** Implicit time constraints
Restricting actions to a-f, the optimal initial sequence requires three time steps.
BY removeing john from task e, barry has to be reallocated to e, but since he is also the sole person responsible for f
the sequence adds one step. 

* Bugs
* New operators
+ Shuffle specific teams.
